# Apolo Framework

This frameworks works with PHP 5.3.3+ so it uses the new features of
PHP and maybe your server do not support, so be carrefull.

The Core makes the basic instructions of Apolo Framework. It means
an easy way to cat Controllers, Models, Routes, Validations,
Libraries, Templates. It mantains a bash script that installs all
components of Apolo Framework.
